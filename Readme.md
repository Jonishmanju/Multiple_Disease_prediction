    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The increasing incidence of heart attacks and diabetes poses a significant health challenge globally. Early detection of these conditions is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications. Our solution targets individuals at risk of these diseases, aiming to mitigate their impact on public health.</p>

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Our project leverages machine learning to analyze health data and predict the likelihood of heart attacks and diabetes. By providing early warnings, individuals can adopt lifestyle modifications and seek medical intervention promptly, thus reducing the burden of these diseases.</p>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>We employed a multi-faceted approach integrating Node.js, React, and machine learning techniques. The system processes diverse health parameters and employs predictive algorithms to generate actionable insights. The following flowchart illustrates our technical workflow:</p>
